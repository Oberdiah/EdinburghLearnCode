Each script is broken down into 'Blocks'.  So code like:

IF x < 5 THEN place block at 0,0 ELSE place block at 1,1

would become, in block form:
                    ON LOAD
                      |
        ----------IF [x < 5]---------
       |                             |
 [PLACE dirt BLOCK at 0,0] [PLACE dirt BLOCK AT 1,1]

 Each block has 3 properties: incoming nodes, outgoing nodes, and inner nodes.

 Incoming nodes are the 'previous line of code'.  So IF [x < 5] has 1 incoming node, "ON LOAD"

 Outgoing nodes are the 'next line of code', which may be complicated if you have a control statement.  "ON LOAD" has 1
 outgoing node, "IF [x < 5]", but IF [x < 5] has 2, 1 for if the statement is true and 1 for when it is false.

 Inner nodes are the actual raw values that you are using. So If [x < 5] has 2 inner nodes, 'x' and '5'.
 "PLACE dirt BLOCK at 0,0" has 3: dirt, 0, and 0.

 That is all there is to it.  You can access them using the following:
 block.getIncomingNodes() //returns an ArrayList<Node>
 block.getOutgoingNodes() //returns an ArrayList<Node>
 block.getInnerNodes()    //returns a LinkedHashMap<String,String>.  An example of this would be:
                                IF [PLACE dirt BLOCK at 0,0] has inner nodes { "[BlockName]":"dirt","[PosX]":"0","[PosY]":"0" }

 If you want to add your own blocks, in Block.java there are two places to look:
 public void drawTheFrigginText() and public Block()
 And also add it to the enum in BlockTypes.java
 Just add the stuff in there that you need.  [PLACE ___ BLOCK at _,_] is implemented like this:

 public Block():
 /* code above ...*/
 else if (type == BlockTypes.PLACE_BLOCK) {
       incomingNodes.addAll(makeNodes(1,true));//incoming: prev line
       outgoingNodes.addAll(makeNodes(1,false));//outgoing: next line
       innerNodes.put("[BlockName]","Dirt");
       innerNodes.put("[PosX]","0");
       innerNodes.put("[PosY]","0");
  }
  /* code below ...*/

  public void drawTheFrigginText():
  /* code above ...*/
  else if (type == BlockTypes.PLACE_BLOCK) {
       str = "Place Block [BlockName] at ([PosX],[PosY])";
  }
  /* code below ...*/

  And "PLACE_BLOCK" must be added to the enum list in BlockTypes
